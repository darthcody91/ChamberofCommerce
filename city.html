       <h1>TREMONTON</h1>

        <p>Tremonton is located in the Bear River Valley, just west of the Bear River, along Interstate 15, and about
            seven miles south of the confluence of the Malad and Bear rivers. Its elevation is 4,322 feet above sea
            level and about 120 feet above the mean level of the Great Salt Lake, which lies some fifteen miles south
            and west of the city. Tremonton is the second largest city in Box Elder County. </p>

        <p> The founding of Tremonton differed in many respects from the settlement of a vast majority of its sister
            communities in the valley. Most of the families pushing north and west to establish homes in the region were
            Mormon; but the first people of Tremonton and vicinity were non-Mormon. They were people who brought with
            them a variety of religious beliefs from their former homes. They also were an industrious, progressive, and
            sincere people who, regardless of differences in belief, were willing to cooperate with their neighbors.
            These qualities were evident when they constructed the first Union schoolhouse to educate all their
            children. They further united (hence the name "Union") by sharing that building on Sunday, when several
            denominations used it during the course of the day for their services.</p>
        <p>
            Tremonton is a modern city. From 1906, when it was first incorporated as a town, to 1918, when it was
            designated a third-class city, to the present, growth has been steady. Educational, recreational, civic,
            health, medical, and religious services and facilities have been updated and expanded with the steady growth
            of the city. Economically, the city is a central shopping place for the Bear River Valley.</p>
